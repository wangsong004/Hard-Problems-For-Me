- Calculating the signed minimum distance between a polyline and a triangular mesh.  

- Thickening an open contour triangular mesh in one direction to generate a closed solid algorithm. 

- For Boolean operations on two closed triangular meshes (A and B), it is usually necessary to find all self-intersecting triangles for A and B, respectively, before performing the Boolean operation. Is there a way to get a reasonable Boolean operation result without finding all self-intersecting triangles, but only the necessary self-intersecting triangles?
